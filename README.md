# Learning_Python_Day5

Today's topic is loops!

**Goal:** Automate repetitive tasks using for and while loops

- **task1:** Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop

- **task2:** Print even numbers from 0 to 20

- **task3:** Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1

- **task4:** Ask the user for a number and print its multiplication table

- **task5:** Create a simple guess the number game (loop until correct)

**mini-project:**
Number Guessing Game:  
The computer picks a random number from 1 to 20  
(use: `import random` and `secret = random.randint(1, 20)`).

The user has 5 attempts to guess the number.  
After each guess, print:
- "too high" or  
- "too low"

End the game after the correct guess or after 5 attempts.
